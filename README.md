# JavaRMIServerClient
Simple project that allows two computers to communicate via the java remote interface
The IP address is set to 0.0.0.0, this needs to be changed before the code is run (for example, computer 1 needs the 
ip address of computer 2, and computer 2 needs the ip address of computer 1).
The port numbers for setting and looking for each register needs to be the opposite way around on each computer
